      <p class="content">
        Informal Negotiations To expedite resolution and control the cost of any
        dispute, controversy, or claim related to these Terms of Use (each
        "Dispute" and collectively, the “Disputes”) brought by either you or us
        (individually, a “Party” and collectively, the “Parties”), the Parties
        agree to first attempt to negotiate any Dispute (except those Disputes
        expressly provided below) informally for at least thirty (30) days
        before initiating arbitration. Such informal negotiations commence upon
        written notice from one Party to the other Party.
      </p>
      <p>Binding Arbitration</p>
      <p>
        Any dispute arising out of or in connection with this contract,
        including any question regarding its existence, validity, or
        termination, shall be referred to and finally resolved by the
        International Commercial Arbitration Court under the European
        Arbitration Chamber (Belgium, Brussels, Avenue Louise, 146) according to
        the Rules of this ICAC, which, as a result of referring to it, is
        considered as the part of this clause. The number of arbitrators shall
        be three (3). The seat, or legal place, of arbitration shall be
        Malaysia, Malaysia. The language of the proceedings shall be English.
        The governing law of the contract shall be the substantive law of
        Malaysia.
      </p>
      <p>Restrictions</p>
      <p>
        The Parties agree that any arbitration shall be limited to the Dispute
        between the Parties individually. To the full extent permitted by law,
      </p>
      <p>(a) no arbitration shall be joined with any other proceeding;</p>
      <p>
        (b) there is no right or authority for any Dispute to be arbitrated on a
        class-action basis or to utilize class-action procedures; and
      </p>
      <p>
        (c) there is no right or authority for any Dispute to be brought in a
        purported representative capacity on behalf of the general public or any
        other persons.
      </p>
      <p>Exceptions to Informal Negotiations and Arbitration</p>
      <p>
        The Parties agree that the following Disputes are not subject to the
        above provisions concerning informal negotiations and binding
        arbitration:
      </p>
      <p>
        (a) any Disputes seeking to enforce or protect, or concerning the
        validity of, any of the intellectual property rights of a Party;
      </p>
      <p>
        (b) any Dispute related to, or arising from, allegations of theft,
        piracy, invasion of privacy, or unauthorized use; and
      </p>
      <p>
        (c) any claim for injunctive relief. If this provision is found to be
        illegal or unenforceable, then neither Party will elect to arbitrate any
        Dispute falling within that portion of this provision found to be
        illegal or unenforceable and such Dispute shall be decided by a court of
        competent jurisdiction within the courts listed for jurisdiction above,
        and the Parties agree to submit to the personal jurisdiction of that
        court.
